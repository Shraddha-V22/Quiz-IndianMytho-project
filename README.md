# A Quiz on Ancient Indian Stories

This is a Quiz project on a particular topic. I chose Indian mythology.  
I used ReadlineSync package to interact with the user and take answers from him. and I used the keyInSelect property of readlineSync to give options and get the answer by just clicking only one key.  
This, hopefully make the quiz user-friendly.  
I have made three levels and only after clearing the level 1 can user go to level 2. Likewise, after clearing level 1 and 2 both, user can proceed to level 3.  
I will make some more changes ahead.
